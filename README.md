👋 Hi, I’m Puneet Rai (@Puneetpotter), and currently I am pursuing bachelors in Computer Science with Big Data Analytics.

👀 I’m interested in programming languages such as C, C++, HTML and Python for now.

🌱 I’m currently learning Data Structures more deeply with C++ as well as Python and I am also parrellely doing Machine Learning.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on problem solving situations for now.
